# Landing Page Project

## Instructions
Download or Clone the project to your local machine.

Open the project in a code editor, such as Visual Studio Code or any text editor of your choice.

To modify the content, add new <section> elements to the index.html. Each section should have:

A unique id for identification.
A data-nav attribute to define the text displayed in the navigation .

The JavaScript file (js/app.js) automatically detects new sections and adds them to the navigation menu.

To style new sections, add necessary CSS rules in css/styles.css.

Test the page in a browser to ensure all sections and the navigation behave as expected.

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality
